# Horiseon-Refractor-Challenge-

The Horiseon Refactor Challenge was created when AS A marketing agency, the codebase for the original Horiseon Website is refactored to improve accessibility standards SO THAT the website is optimized for search engines. 

## Description 

The two major changes made to the original code of this website are that images now include a detailed description for accessibility and a concise and descriptive title now provide keywords to facilitate the site to be find easier in search engines. It also now follows a logical and structured set of HTML and CSS elements for styling and positioning throughout.

VS Code was used to refactot the website's code. 

One of the challenges for this project was to understand that a background image on CSS does not necesarily need an alt description, but is used merely for asthetics.
